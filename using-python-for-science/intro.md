Welcome to Using Python for Science
===================================

If you are a scientist wondering what this Python thing is all about, this book
is for you. If you're a scientist and you've started working with Python, but
now you are wondering about best practices, and how to be more effective, this
book is also for you!

If you are an expert in scientific Python... Well, you probably know most of
the stuff in here, but we'd love your help making it better! So you should read
it also. ;)
