# Working with GitHub

(Or other git collaboration platforms such as GitLab.)

Git is a tool to control revisions. GitHub is a web service centered on git. It
provides repository hosting as well as a suite of workflows to aid
collaboration.

In this section you will learn about *remote repositories*, which are histories
that are not in to your working directory. The operations involved in using
these include clone, push, pull, fork, and pull requests.

## Pushing your project back to GitHub

You started out creating a project on GitHub, which you cloned to your
own computer. All the changes you recorded since then are stored
*locally*, on your computer. You need to explicitly tell git that you
want to *push* the changes back to GitHub.

To understand how to do this, you need to keep in mind that git is
distributed: every copy of your data contains the entire history. There
is nothing special about your local copy vs GitHub's copy vs the copy
on your department's computing servers. Therefore, you have to deal
with "remotes", which are your local git's address book of other copies
of the history. Check it out:

```console
$ git remote
origin
```

Git is saying that it knows about a single remote repository, called
origin. To see what it knows *about* this remote, use the `-v` (verbose)
flag:

```console
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:jni/pycalc (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:jni/pycalc (push)
```

That tells both the name of the remote, *and its location*. "origin" is
the default name for the remote from which you cloned the current
repository.

Think of the output like an *address book* for the repo: the names on the
left, and the addresses on the right.

Now, push your local changes back to the origin:

```console
$ git push origin master:master
Counting objects: 36, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
Writing objects: 100% (36/36), 3.33 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 36 (delta 25), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:jni/pycalc
   8ab0457..8de6fb7  master -> master
```

Read the above as "push to "origin" my branch "master" onto its branch
"master". Branches are managed locally for each repository, so the branch names
don't actually have to match. That is, we could easily have written:

```console
$ git push origin master:other-branch-name
```

and then the contents of our branch `master` locally would be mirrored in the
remote branch `other-branch-name` on `origin`. In order to tell git to keep
track of matching branch names, use the option `--set-upstream`:

```console
$ git push origin --set-upstream master
```

This tells git: "push `master` onto `origin`'s `master`, and note that they are
mirrors of each other." This means that later, we only need to do:

```console
$ git push origin
```

And git will know that `master` goes onto `origin`'s `master`.

After this, you'll be able to refresh your page on GitHub and
browse your code's history.

## Exercise 4: GitHub pull requests

For this exercise you will have to pair up with your neighbour, which
we will name Alice. (And your name is Bob, in keeping with the computer
science literature.) Decide now who will be Bob and who will be Alice in the
pair.

As Bob, you should delete your "pycalc" repository on GitHub (this is done
under "Settings" in the right-hand menu). You've realised that Alice has her
own version and that you can both save effort by collaborating on this project.

You've been wanting to do some arithmetic on some data, but the first
number you need to add is often a decimal number. In those cases, the
`compute` function falls short. (How?)

You want to modify it so that the first number is allowed to be a decimal
number.

Navigate to Alice's repository on GitHub
(https://github.com/[Alice's username]/pycalc), and click the "Fork"
button.
This will create a copy of Alice's repo on your GitHub account, which
you can then clone on your machine as before. But note that you need to
delete your existing work, or git will complain! Instructions below (some of
the directories and obviously the "bob" username needs to be changed to
yours!):

```console
$ pwd
/Users/bob/projects/pycalc
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf pycalc
$ git clone git@github.com:alice/pycalc
$ cd pycalc
$ git switch --create decimals
```

Edit the `calc.py` file so that `num0` is converted with `float`
instead of `int`. (Leave `num1` unchanged for now.)

Now commit those changes and push them *to a new branch on GitHub*. If you use
the `--set-upstream` flag, you tell git to create a branch with the same
name that "tracks" the current branch. This makes future pushes easier.

```console
$ git add calc.py
$ git commit -m "Allow num0 to be any decimal number"
$ git push origin --set-upstream decimals
```

Go to the GitHub page for the project. You should see a new button
showing that you've recently updated a branch and prompting you to
*initiate a pull request*. (You can also copy the "new pull request" address
from git's message when you push.)

Here's how this works: you don't know Alice. You probably have never met
her. So it's natural that you can't just push random stuff willy-nilly to her
repository. However, you do have a *shared history*, because you *forked* hers,
and *she* has access to your new changes. So, instead of *pushing* your
changes, you ask *her* to *pull* from your own history.

The PR will tell Alice that you've made some
changes to the code and you would like her to incorporate them into
her project. Notice that you did this *without needing any special
access from Alice!* This is the magic of GitHub and open source.

Check out the impact that GitHub has had on a few open source Python projects:

Click on the PR button and fill in the form. Filling in a useful
title and message here is very important!

Alice should get an email notification that there is a pull request to
her project. Clicking on it, she will be taken to the web form for the
PR, where she can examine the changes that Bob has made (the "Files" tab).

Alice will note that this great change would be made much more useful if it
also used `float` for `num1`! She comments on the
PR page: "This is a great addition, thanks! Could you please do the same for
num1?"

On his machine, Bob makes the requested change, commits, and pushes his changes:

```console
$ #  ... edit calc.py ...
$ git add calc.py
$ git commit -m "Use float for num1's conversion also"
$ git push  # no need to specify repo or branch anymore, having `set-upstream`
```

If either Bob or Alice go back to the PR page, they will see that the PR has
been automagically updated with Bob's new changes! (Though they may need to
refresh the page.)

Alice, satisfied with the update, can now click on the "Merge pull
request" button and incorporate Bob's changes to her code!

One last thing needs to happen to really synchronise everyone's histories.
Although Alice has Bob's changes, *Bob doesn't have Alice's commit
incorporating his changes.* If he continues to work on his `decimals` branch,
their histories will diverge. And if he works on his `master` branch, his
changes won't be there!

The solution is for him to *pull* the master branch *from Alice's repository*.
For this, he needs to add it to his list of remotes (remember remotes?):

```console
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:bob/pycalc (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:bob/pycalc (push)
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:alice/pycalc
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:bob/pycalc (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:bob/pycalc (push)
upstream	git@github.com:alice/pycalc (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:alice/pycalc (push)
$ git switch master
$ git pull upstream master  # get upstream's master branch, and merge
$ git push origin master
```

Bob can now inspect his history log and see that both his changes and Alice's
merge are there. Use GitKraken/GitX/GitTower/other GUI for this, or the `lsd`
alias we learned earlier, or a simple git-log will also do.

## Bonus exercise 1: self-PRs and code review

Do the reverse approach, which is a bit different. Alice has gained a
collaborator in Bob. Even though she still maintains control of the project
repository, she wants to enlist his help. She creates a branch, adds a line or
two (for example, she might want to add a test function, `test_compute`, that
runs `compute` for a few known values and makes sure the results match up), then
*creates a PR against her own repository.* She then asks Bob to review her
change by mentioning his username (e.g. `@bob`, as in Twitter) in a comment on
the PR page. Only when Bob gives his ok (or perhaps he spots a typo) does she
merge.

This practice of requesting code reviews for pull requests, even when you
control the repository, is universal among programming teams, because it
dramatically improves the quality of the code. Two pairs of eyes are more than
twice as effective as one pair.

## Bonus exercise 2: rebasing

Bob thinks testing is a swell idea, and adds a test function at the bottom in
a branch called `test-2`, and makes a PR.

Meanwhile, Alice herself has also been busy and adds a third test function at
the bottom of the same file, before merging Bob's PR.

Bob's pull request now shows a greyed out "Merge" button, because there are
merge conflicts! Unlike before, you don't have access to the history on GitHub,
so you can't just proceed with the merge and fix the merge conflicts.

The common solution is to *rebase*, that is, to replay the changes on Bob's
branch on top of the latest `master` from Alice's repository.

```console
$ git switch master
$ git pull upstream master
$ git rebase master test-2
```

During the rebase, Bob will have merge conflicts. He needs to fix these as
before, `git add` the file, and then `git rebase --continue` to complete the
rebase.

Finally, Bob will try to push back to his GitHub account but this will fail.
(Why?) The solution is to use `git push --force-with-lease`.

## Notes on why you should make your own code open source

- The idea that you will be scooped by someone looking at your code is
  ludicrous. Reading code is *hard work* and no one will do it on the
  off chance that there is a Nature paper buried in there.
- Your own coding habits and practice will improve just by knowing that
  it's out there. (Shame is a powerful motivator! =P)
- If someone *does* look at your code and finds it useful, chances are
  that you will have gained a new collaborator, not a competitor.
- It is just good scientific practice!
- See my blog post [Why scientists should code in the open](https://ilovesymposia.com/2015/12/26/why-scientists-should-code-in-the-open/)
